# RTCDProject

A project on Real Time Collision Detection(RTCD), which builds on the App I created in University, spawning from the following repository:
https://github.com/PC88/RTCD-App

This project will aim to improve upon what was achieved in the limited time frame of a single trimester, 
as such it is now being aimed as a portfolio peice and will further build on what I could do in University.

This show cases a quadtree implementation on collision detection and visualises it using GLUT.
